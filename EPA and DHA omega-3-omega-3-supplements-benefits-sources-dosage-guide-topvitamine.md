# Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Why You Need Them & Where to Get Them

Omega-3 fatty acids are essential polyunsaturated fats with well-established roles in cardiovascular, cognitive and inflammatory regulation. The primary forms are EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and the plant-based ALA (alpha-linolenic acid). Humans convert ALA to EPA and DHA inefficiently, so dietary EPA and DHA are important for predictable physiological effects.

Physiological roles and evidence

EPA and DHA contribute to cell membrane structure in the brain and retina and participate in producing anti-inflammatory lipid mediators. Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses indicate modest but consistent benefits of EPA/DHA for lowering triglyceride concentrations and for certain markers of cardiovascular risk. Evidence for cognitive benefits is stronger in populations with low baseline omega-3 status or in older adults, while results are mixed for primary prevention in well-nourished, younger populations. Omega-3s also reduce production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, which is one mechanism underlying observed improvements in some inflammatory conditions.

Dietary sources and bioavailability

Marine sources—fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel and sardines—provide preformed EPA and DHA and are the most bioavailable dietary option. Plant sources like flaxseed, chia and walnuts supply ALA; only a small fraction (often <10%) converts to EPA and much less to DHA in most people. For predictable EPA/DHA intake, marine foods or marine-derived supplements are typically more efficient than ALA-rich plants.

Supplement considerations

When evaluating supplements, prioritize products specifying EPA and DHA amounts per serving and those tested for contaminants (e.g., heavy metals, PCBs). Purity, stability (oxidation levels) and transparent labeling are useful quality indicators. Some products are third-party certified for content and purity; such certification can aid selection.

Dosage guidance and safety

General dietary guidance often recommends about 250–500 mg combined EPA+DHA per day for maintenance of health in adults. Higher therapeutic doses (e.g., for markedly elevated triglycerides) are used clinically under supervision. Potential adverse effects at very high intakes include increased bleeding tendency and interactions with anticoagulant medications; consult a clinician for tailored advice, especially during pregnancy, lactation or when managing chronic conditions.

Summary

EPA and DHA are central to several physiological processes with demonstrable effects on triglycerides, inflammation and certain aspects of cognitive health. Diets including fatty fish or standardized supplements reliably increase EPA/DHA status; choices should be informed by evidence for dosage, product quality and personal health context.
