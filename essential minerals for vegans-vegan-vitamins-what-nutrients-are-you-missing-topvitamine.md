# Vegan Vitamins: What Nutrients Are You Missing?

Following a vegan diet can deliver many health and environmental benefits, but excluding all animal products also changes nutrient availability. Some micronutrients are predominantly found in animal-derived foods or are present in plant sources in less bioavailable forms. Dietary supplements and targeted food choices can help address these potential gaps while maintaining a plant-based pattern.

Vegan vitamins are supplements formulated without animal-derived ingredients, including capsule materials and nutrient sources. They commonly use fermented vitamin B12, lichen-derived vitamin D3, algal EPA/DHA, and plant-based carriers to avoid gelatin or other animal byproducts. Nutrient selection should be evidence-based and aligned with individual dietary intake and laboratory results when possible.

Key nutrients to monitor on a vegan diet include:

- Vitamin B12: B12 is essential for red blood cell formation, neurological function, and DNA synthesis. Reliable sources for vegans are fortified foods and supplements containing cyanocobalamin or methylcobalamin produced through bacterial fermentation. Regular intake is recommended because plant foods do not provide consistent, bioavailable B12.

- Iron: Plant-based iron (non-heme) is present in legumes, dark leafy greens, and fortified products but is less efficiently absorbed than heme iron from animal foods. Strategies to enhance iron absorption include combining iron-rich foods with vitamin C and avoiding simultaneous intake of strong inhibitors like calcium or high doses of polyphenols.

- Calcium: Adequate calcium supports bone health. Many plant foods contain calcium, but intake and absorption should be considered, especially in those with low consumption of fortified alternatives.

- Zinc: Important for immune function and wound healing, zinc from plant sources can be less bioavailable due to phytates; soaking, fermenting, and diversifying sources can improve availability.

- Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA): Long-chain omega-3s are found mainly in marine sources. Algal oil supplements provide EPA and DHA suitable for vegans and have evidence for supporting cardiovascular and cognitive health markers.

- Vitamin D: Sun exposure produces vitamin D, but many people have limited UVB exposure seasonally. Vegan D3 derived from lichen is an alternative to traditional animal-derived D3 and can help maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations.

Choosing supplements: look for clear labeling of source and dose, third-party testing where available, and formulations that demonstrate bioavailable forms of nutrients. Non-GMO and organic claims can reflect production choices but do not alone guarantee superior efficacy; review ingredient lists and certifications critically.

Probiotics: Vegan-friendly probiotics use plant-based carriers and avoid animal-derived excipients. Strain selection should be linked to intended benefits, and stability through shelf life is an important quality factor.

Routine monitoring (dietary review and blood tests) guides personalized decisions. When supplements are used, selecting evidence-informed formulations and confirming need through assessment helps optimize nutrient status without unnecessary use.
