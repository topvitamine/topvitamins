# Magnesium Citrate vs. Magnesium Bisglycinate – Which One Should You Take?

Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in hundreds of biochemical reactions, including muscle and nerve function, blood sugar regulation, and sleep support. Two commonly recommended forms are magnesium citrate and magnesium bisglycinate. Understanding their chemistry, absorption, benefits, and side effects can help you choose the most appropriate form for your needs.

## Understanding the forms and absorption

Magnesium citrate is a salt of magnesium and citric acid; it dissolves well in the gut and is relatively bioavailable. It tends to act faster and can have an osmotic effect in the intestines, which is why it is sometimes used to relieve occasional constipation. Magnesium bisglycinate (also called magnesium glycinate) consists of magnesium chelated to the amino acid glycine. Chelation can protect magnesium from interaction with other dietary compounds, often improving tolerability and reducing the likelihood of loose stools.

Both forms are generally well absorbed compared with basic oxide forms, but bisglycinate is often reported as gentler on the stomach and less likely to cause gastrointestinal side effects. The glycine component may also contribute to calming effects, which is relevant for people taking magnesium to support sleep or relaxation.

## Key benefits and typical uses

- Magnesium citrate: Commonly used when digestive support is desired. Its ability to draw water into the intestines makes it useful for occasional constipation. It also supports muscle function and can help with cramps when rapid magnesium availability is needed.

- Magnesium bisglycinate: Favoured when the goal is improved sleep quality, relaxation, or when users experience sensitivity to other magnesium forms. The bisglycinate form is less likely to cause diarrhea and may be better tolerated at higher doses.

## Safety and side effects

Both forms are safe for most people when taken within recommended ranges, but side effects differ slightly. Magnesium citrate can cause loose stools or diarrhea at higher doses. Magnesium bisglycinate is less likely to cause gastrointestinal upset but may increase drowsiness in some users, particularly if taken in the evening. People with impaired kidney function should consult a healthcare professional before starting any magnesium supplement because the kidneys regulate magnesium levels.

## Dosing and timing considerations

Typical supplemental doses for adults range from about 200 mg to 400 mg of elemental magnesium per day, depending on dietary intake and individual needs. Starting at a lower dose and gradually increasing can help assess tolerance. Magnesium citrate is often taken with meals to reduce stomach discomfort, whereas magnesium bisglycinate is commonly taken in the evening due to its calming profile.

## Practical decision guide

- If your primary concern is occasional constipation or rapid relief of muscle cramps, magnesium citrate may be appropriate.
- If your priority is sleep, relaxation, or gastrointestinal sensitivity, magnesium bisglycinate is often the better choice.

## Takeaway

Choosing between magnesium citrate and magnesium bisglycinate depends on your goals and tolerance. Both provide bioavailable magnesium; citrate is useful for digestion and cramps, while bisglycinate is often preferred for sleep and gentleness on the gut. When in doubt, discuss supplementation with a healthcare professional who can account for your medical history and concurrent medications.
