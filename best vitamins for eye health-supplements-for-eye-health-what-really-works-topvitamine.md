# Supplements for Eye Health: What Really Works?

Maintaining eye health is important for daily function and quality of life. With prolonged screen time and environmental stressors, many people ask whether supplements can meaningfully support vision. An evidence-based approach focuses on nutrients with demonstrated roles in retinal protection, lens clarity, and tear film function.

## Common eye issues and nutritional relevance

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cataracts, and dry eye are among the most common problems affecting adults. AMD affects central vision and is associated with oxidative stress and aging of the macula. Cataracts involve protein changes in the lens, and dry eye relates to tear production and surface inflammation. Nutrition influences these processes: antioxidants can reduce oxidative damage, omega-3 fatty acids modulate inflammation, and certain minerals support retinal metabolism.

## Key ingredients supported by research

- Lutein and zeaxanthin: These carotenoids accumulate in the macula and selectively filter high-energy blue light. Randomized trials and observational studies link higher macular pigment and dietary intake of lutein/zeaxanthin to lower risk or slower progression of AMD and to improved visual performance under glare.

- Vitamins A, C, and E: Vitamin A is essential for photoreceptor function and low-light vision. Vitamins C and E act as antioxidants protecting ocular tissues from free-radical damage. Large supplement trials (such as components of AREDS/AREDS2) have demonstrated benefits of antioxidant combinations for certain AMD stages.

- Zinc: Zinc is involved in transporting vitamin A to the retina and in numerous enzymatic processes. In combination with antioxidants, zinc has been shown to influence AMD progression in clinical studies.

- Omega-3 fatty acids: Eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) support retinal cell membranes and have anti-inflammatory effects. Evidence supports a role for omega-3s in improving symptoms of dry eye; links to AMD prevention are less conclusive but biologically plausible.

## How to interpret the evidence

Supplements most clearly benefit people with early or intermediate AMD when formulations reflect the evidence base (antioxidants plus zinc and, in some cases, lutein/zeaxanthin). For the general population, achieving a nutrient-rich diet remains the foundation: leafy greens, colorful vegetables, nuts, fatty fish, and fruits supply many of the relevant compounds.

## Practical guidance for incorporation

- Choose supplements whose formulations and dosages align with published clinical trials, and follow label directions.
- Take fat-soluble nutrients (lutein, zeaxanthin, vitamins A and E, omega-3s) with meals containing some fat to improve absorption.
- Discuss long-term supplementation with a healthcare professional, particularly if you have preexisting conditions or are taking medications.

## Conclusion

Evidence supports specific nutrients—lutein, zeaxanthin, vitamins A, C, E, zinc, and omega-3s—as contributors to eye health, particularly in the context of AMD risk or symptomatic dry eye. Supplements can complement a nutrient-dense diet, but choices should be informed by clinical evidence and individual health needs rather than marketing claims.
