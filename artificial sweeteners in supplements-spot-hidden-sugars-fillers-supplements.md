## Introduction

Dietary supplements are commonplace, but what’s inside a pill, gummy, or powder isn’t always obvious. Hidden sugars, sugar alcohols, artificial sweeteners, and inert fillers can influence blood glucose, gut health, and tolerability. This article explains how to read supplement labels and recognize common deceptive terms so you can make informed choices.

## Hidden sugars: what to look for

Manufacturers often add sweeteners to improve flavor. These may appear under many names, including glucose syrup, maltodextrin, evaporated cane juice, agave, and fruit juice concentrates. Even products labeled “sugar-free” can include sweet carbohydrate syrups. One practical tip: check the Nutrition Facts panel for “Total Sugars” and “Added Sugars,” and scan the first five items in the ingredient list—if a sweetener appears there, it’s likely a significant component.

## Sugar alcohols and digestive effects

Sugar alcohols such as xylitol, sorbitol, erythritol, and mannitol are common in “no-sugar” chewables and gummies. They provide sweetness with lower glycemic impact but are poorly absorbed in some people and can cause bloating, gas, cramping, or diarrhoea—effects that are dose dependent. If you have irritable bowel symptoms or follow a low-FODMAP plan, inspect labels closely for polyols.

## Artificial sweeteners and metabolic considerations

Non-nutritive sweeteners like sucralose, aspartame, and acesulfame-K are used for calorie-free sweetness. Emerging evidence suggests some sweeteners may alter gut microbiota or influence metabolic signaling, though findings vary by compound and dose. When monitoring blood sugar, appetite, or gut symptoms, consider avoiding supplements that rely on synthetic sweeteners as primary flavoring agents.

## Common fillers and inactive ingredients

Inactive ingredients—listed as “Other Ingredients”—can include binders and anti-caking agents such as magnesium stearate, silicon dioxide, microcrystalline cellulose, and titanium dioxide. While generally recognized as safe at low levels, fillers can matter for people with sensitivities, allergies, or those avoiding certain agricultural sources. If traceability or minimal-excipient formulations matter to you, favor products that disclose full ingredient sources and manufacturing details.

## Reading labels: practical checklist

- Read both the Supplement Facts and Other Ingredients sections.
- Watch for multiple sweeteners and note their order in the ingredient list.
- Identify sugar alcohols and non-nutritive sweeteners by name.
- Be cautious with vague terms like “natural flavors” or “proprietary blend.”
- Cross-reference products with independent test results when possible.
