## Introduction

Recovery from colds and influenza benefits from more than symptom relief: targeted nutritional support can accelerate healing and help restore immune function. Research supports several vitamins, minerals, and botanicals that modulate immune response, reduce symptom duration, and support mucosal and antioxidant defenses. This article summarizes evidence-based supplements, practical dosing ranges, and complementary lifestyle measures.

## Key supplements for acute recovery

Vitamin C, zinc, and vitamin D are among the most consistently studied micronutrients for respiratory infections. Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant and supports neutrophil and lymphocyte function; common recovery doses range from 500–1000 mg twice daily. Zinc, particularly as lozenges containing zinc acetate or gluconate, can reduce symptom duration when started at onset; typical short-term doses are 15–30 mg/day (avoid chronic doses >40 mg/day without supervision). Vitamin D3 supports innate immunity and mucosal defenses; maintenance dosing usually falls between 1000–4000 IU/day depending on serum 25(OH)D levels.

Botanicals with antiviral and immunomodulatory effects include elderberry (Sambucus nigra) and echinacea. Elderberry extract taken within 48 hours of symptom onset has been associated with shorter symptom duration in several trials. Echinacea purpurea can enhance macrophage activity and may reduce incidence and severity when used early.

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is useful for its role in glutathione synthesis and mucolytic activity; doses of 600–1200 mg once or twice daily can aid mucus clearance and antioxidant defenses.

## Preventive immune boosters

Longer-term approaches focus on immune resilience: beta-glucans, quercetin, garlic extract, and medicinal mushroom blends (Reishi, Shiitake, Maitake) support macrophage, NK cell, and T-cell responses. Example preventive doses:
- Beta-glucans: 250–500 mg/day
- Quercetin: 250–500 mg/day (often combined with bromelain)
- Aged garlic extract: 600–1200 mg/day
- Mushroom blends: 1–2 g/day

These are typically taken consistently over weeks to months rather than as single high-dose interventions.

## Herbal remedies and supportive nutrients

Andrographis paniculata has evidence for reducing symptom severity in upper respiratory infections. Licorice root (or DGL forms) and turmeric/ginger extracts provide anti-inflammatory and soothing actions; be mindful of licorice glycyrrhizin and blood pressure effects.

Recovery-phase vitamins include B-complex (for energy metabolism and stress response) and vitamin A for mucosal repair. Standard recovery regimens emphasize balanced, bioavailable forms—methylcobalamin for B12, P-5-P for B6, and dietary sources alongside supplementation.

## Practical considerations and resources

Choose high-quality, contaminant-tested products and formulations that enhance absorption (e.g., liposomal vitamin C, bioavailable vitamin D3). Avoid megadosing and consider medical history, medications, and pregnancy when selecting supplements.
