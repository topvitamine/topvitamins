# Vegan Vitamins: What Nutrients You Might Be Missing

Choosing a vegan diet can offer health benefits such as lower cholesterol and reduced cardiovascular risk, but eliminating animal products increases the likelihood of gaps in certain nutrients. Identifying which vitamins and minerals are less available in plant-based diets helps inform food choices and supplementation strategies to maintain health and function.

## Nutrients that require attention on a vegan diet

Vitamin B12 is arguably the most critical nutrient for people following a strict plant-based diet. B12 is essential for neurologic function and red blood cell formation, and deficiency can lead to fatigue, neuropathy, and anemia. Because reliable B12 sources are primarily animal-derived, fortified foods and supplements are common approaches for vegans to meet recommended intakes. Evidence-based guidance supports routine B12 supplementation or regular monitoring of serum B12 and methylmalonic acid in long-term vegans.

Vitamin D supports bone health, muscle function, and immune regulation. Endogenous synthesis from sunlight is the main source for many people, but seasonal variation, latitude, skin pigmentation, and indoor lifestyles can reduce synthesis. Plant-based vitamin D supplements are available (typically vitamin D2 from fungi or lichen-derived vitamin D3) and can help maintain adequate serum 25(OH)D levels when sunlight exposure is insufficient.

Iron is present in plant foods as non-heme iron, which is less efficiently absorbed than heme iron from animal products. Consuming vitamin C–rich foods alongside iron-containing plant foods (for example, citrus with legumes) enhances absorption. Monitoring hemoglobin and ferritin may be appropriate if symptoms or risk factors for deficiency exist.

Omega-3 long-chain fatty acids (EPA and DHA) are important for cardiovascular and cognitive health. ALA-rich plant foods such as flaxseed, chia, and walnuts provide precursors, but conversion to EPA and DHA is limited in humans. Algal-derived EPA/DHA supplements provide a direct vegan source supported by clinical research.

Calcium and zinc are additional minerals to monitor. Many plant foods contain calcium, but oxalates in some vegetables can inhibit absorption. Fortified plant milks and varied sources (tofu, leafy greens with lower oxalate content) can support calcium intake. Zinc absorption can be reduced by phytates; strategies include soaking, fermenting, and consuming a diverse diet to improve bioavailability.

## Selecting evidence-based plant-based supplements

When considering supplements, prioritize products with clear labeling of dose and form, third-party testing, and manufacturing quality. Fortified foods can complement supplements; for instance, some plant milks and breakfast cereals provide B12 and vitamin D.

Periodic blood tests and consultation with a healthcare professional help tailor supplementation to individual needs and avoid both deficiency and excess.

## Summary

A well-planned vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate, but attention to vitamin B12, vitamin D, iron, omega-3s, calcium, and zinc reduces the risk of deficiency. Combining food-based strategies (fortified foods, absorption-enhancing practices) with targeted plant-based supplements can help meet nutrient needs.
