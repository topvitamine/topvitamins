Magnesium is a critical mineral involved in more than 300 enzymatic reactions, including energy production, muscle contraction, nerve signalling and regulation of heart rhythm. Suboptimal magnesium status can present with subtle symptoms that progress if unaddressed. This article summarizes common signs of magnesium insufficiency and evidence-based approaches to correct it.

### Recognizing common signs
Physical signs often appear first. Muscle cramps, twitches and generalized weakness are classic manifestations because magnesium helps regulate muscle excitability. Persistent fatigue or low energy can reflect impaired cellular energy metabolism. Cardiac symptoms may include palpitations or irregular heartbeat in more pronounced deficiency.

Mental and cognitive effects are also frequent. Low magnesium has been associated with increased anxiety, irritability, difficulty sleeping and concentration problems or “brain fog.” Headaches and migraine prevalence are higher in some groups with lower magnesium levels; several trials suggest magnesium supplementation can reduce migraine frequency in certain patients.

### Typical causes of low magnesium
Dietary insufficiency is common where intake of magnesium-rich foods is low. Conditions that impair absorption (e.g., chronic diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel disease) or increase losses (e.g., poorly controlled diabetes, chronic alcohol use, certain diuretics) also contribute. High physiological stress can increase magnesium turnover. Identifying the likely cause helps guide remediation.

### Dietary and lifestyle approaches
Prioritize whole-food sources: green leafy vegetables (e.g., spinach), nuts and seeds (almonds, pumpkin seeds), legumes, whole grains and some fish provide bioavailable magnesium. Adequate hydration, moderating alcohol intake and managing chronic stress also support magnesium balance. For most people, diet plus lifestyle changes are foundational steps.

### Magnesium glycinate: absorption and tolerability
Magnesium comes in multiple supplement forms. Magnesium glycinate (magnesium bound to glycine) is notable for its high bioavailability and improved gastrointestinal tolerability compared with some other salts. Clinical evidence and pharmacokinetic data indicate it is less likely to cause diarrhoea and may be preferable for individuals with sensitive digestion or those requiring sustained supplementation.

Supplementation trials often use magnesium glycinate or citrate to restore status; choice should match clinical needs, tolerability and potential interactions. Dosing should consider baseline intake, symptoms and renal function. Healthcare professional guidance is recommended, especially in the presence of comorbidities or medication use.

### When to seek testing or medical advice
If symptoms are persistent, severe or accompanied by cardiac irregularities, neurological changes or other concerning signs, a medical evaluation is warranted. Serum magnesium is one marker but may not reflect total body stores; clinicians sometimes use clinical assessment and risk factors in decision-making.

In summary, early recognition of muscle, cognitive or mood changes paired with dietary adjustments and, when appropriate, well-chosen supplementation such as magnesium glycinate can help restore balance. Clinical evaluation helps tailor safe and effective care for individuals with significant or persistent symptoms.
