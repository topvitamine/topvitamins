# What Are Trace Minerals and Why Your Body Needs Them

Trace minerals are micronutrients required in very small amounts but with outsized importance for health. Though needed in quantities often measured in micrograms or milligrams per day, trace minerals contribute to fundamental processes such as oxygen transport, enzyme catalysis, antioxidant defenses, and immune competence. Maintaining adequate levels supports metabolic balance; deficiencies can impair multiple body systems.

## What trace minerals do

Common trace minerals include iron, zinc, copper, selenium, and manganese. Iron is central to hemoglobin and cellular respiration, transporting oxygen to tissues. Zinc is a cofactor for hundreds of enzymes and plays key roles in immune function, DNA synthesis, and wound healing. Copper participates in energy production and connective tissue formation. Selenium is a component of selenoproteins involved in antioxidant defense and thyroid hormone metabolism. Manganese contributes to bone formation, energy metabolism, and antioxidant enzyme function.

These minerals often function as cofactors for enzymes, stabilizers of protein structure, or components of signaling pathways. Because many enzymatic reactions depend on trace elements, even modest shortages can slow metabolic reactions and disrupt homeostasis.

## Causes and signs of deficiency

Deficiencies can arise from inadequate dietary intake, poor absorption due to gastrointestinal conditions, interactions with other nutrients (for example, excess phytates can reduce mineral bioavailability), or increased physiological needs such as pregnancy. Signs of deficiency depend on the specific mineral but may include fatigue, weakness, impaired immunity, delayed wound healing, hair loss, or cognitive changes. Iron deficiency commonly presents with anemia and fatigue, while zinc deficiency is often associated with immune dysfunction and poor wound repair.

If deficiency is suspected, clinical testing (blood measures or specific functional markers) is the appropriate way to confirm status and guide treatment.

## Dietary sources and absorption

A varied, minimally processed diet is the most reliable way to obtain trace minerals. Good sources include lean meats, seafood, legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and leafy green vegetables. Animal-based foods generally provide minerals in more bioavailable forms, whereas some plant foods contain compounds (phytates, oxalates) that can reduce absorption. Food preparation techniques—soaking, fermenting, and sprouting—can improve mineral availability in plant-based diets.

## Supplements and safe use

Supplements can help address documented shortfalls, particularly when dietary restrictions, absorption issues, or increased needs exist. Selection should be based on laboratory assessment and professional guidance, since inappropriate supplementation can cause toxicity or interfere with absorption of other minerals. For example, excess iron can be harmful, and excess zinc can impede copper uptake.

## Practical recommendations

Aim for dietary variety across food groups to support trace mineral intake. Consider targeted testing if symptoms suggest deficiency or if you have medical conditions affecting nutrient absorption. When supplements are recommended, use evidence-based dosing under clinical supervision to restore and maintain healthy levels.
