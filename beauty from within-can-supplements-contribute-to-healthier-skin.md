## Introduction

Skin health reflects a combination of genetics, environment, skincare habits, and nutrition. Beyond topical products, targeted supplementation can support skin structure, barrier function, and inflammatory balance. This article summarizes evidence for several nutrients (vitamin C, vitamin D, omega‑3s, magnesium, and vitamin K), and points to resources for further reading.

## Nutrition and skin physiology

The skin requires micronutrients for collagen synthesis, antioxidant defense, cellular turnover, and barrier maintenance. Antioxidants such as vitamins C and E neutralize free radicals that contribute to photoaging. Essential fatty acids support the lipid matrix that retains moisture and reduces transepidermal water loss. Deficiencies in specific nutrients can manifest as dryness, impaired wound healing, or increased inflammation, so correcting insufficiencies is a reasonable clinical strategy.

## Vitamin C: collagen and antioxidant support

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a cofactor for proline and lysine hydroxylation during collagen formation and has direct antioxidant activity in the skin. Oral supplementation has been associated with improved skin texture and reduced signs of aging in some clinical studies, particularly when dietary intake is inadequate. Topical and oral vitamin C target different compartments; oral intake supports systemic availability while topical formulations concentrate cutaneous levels.

## Vitamin D: immune modulation and barrier function

Vitamin D receptors are present in keratinocytes and immune cells in the skin. Adequate vitamin D status supports epidermal differentiation and modulates cutaneous immune responses, which may be relevant for conditions such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. In populations with low sun exposure, supplementation can restore physiological levels; clinical benefits for specific dermatologic conditions depend on baseline status and require individualized assessment.

## Omega‑3 fatty acids: anti‑inflammatory lipids

Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) exert anti‑inflammatory effects and influence sebum composition and barrier integrity. Trials suggest omega‑3 supplementation can reduce inflammatory acne lesions and improve skin hydration in some individuals. When inflammation is a prominent driver of skin symptoms, omega‑3s are a rational adjunct to other measures.

## Magnesium and vitamin K: supporting repair and appearance

Magnesium participates in numerous enzymatic processes including those involved in cellular repair and stress responses; low magnesium status may exacerbate stress‑related skin issues. Vitamin K plays a role in vascular health and wound healing, and topical or systemic vitamin K has been investigated for bruising and dark circles. Evidence is mixed but suggests potential benefit when deficiencies or localized needs are present.

## Practical considerations

Supplements are most useful to correct documented or likely deficiencies and to complement a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fatty fish, nuts, and whole grains. Safety, dose, and potential interactions matter—consultation with a healthcare professional is advisable.

## Conclusion

A balanced diet remains foundational for skin health. Targeted supplementation can support collagen production, inflammation control, and barrier integrity when used based on need and evidence. Modest, evidence‑based expectations and professional guidance will optimize outcomes while minimizing risk.
