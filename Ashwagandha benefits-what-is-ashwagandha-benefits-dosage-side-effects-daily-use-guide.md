# What Is Ashwagandha and Should You Take It Daily?

Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is a traditional medicinal herb used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine. Often labeled an adaptogen, it is believed to help the body respond to stressors and support overall resilience. Modern research has examined several proposed effects, including stress reduction, energy support, and immune modulation.

## What Is Ashwagandha?

Ashwagandha is a small woody shrub native to India and parts of the Middle East. Supplements typically use extracts of the root, standardized for active compounds called withanolides. These constituents have been the focus of clinical research investigating physiological effects on the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems.

## Evidence-based Benefits

- Stress and anxiety: Multiple randomized controlled trials suggest ashwagandha can reduce perceived stress and lower cortisol in adults with chronic stress, with moderate effect sizes in several studies.
- Energy, strength, and endurance: Some trials report modest improvements in cardiorespiratory endurance and muscle strength when ashwagandha is used alongside exercise programs.
- Immune support and antioxidant effects: Laboratory and preliminary clinical data indicate antioxidant activity and potential immune-modulating effects, though larger trials are needed to confirm clinical outcomes.

These findings are promising but not definitive; study designs, populations, and product formulations vary, which affects generalizability.

## How to Take Ashwagandha

Ashwagandha is available as capsules, powders, and liquid extracts. Capsules with standardized root extract are common in clinical studies and offer precise dosing. Powders can be mixed into beverages; extracts may absorb faster for some users. Timing can be individualized: some people take it in the morning for daytime support, others in the evening to aid sleep.

## Typical Dosage

Clinical studies most often use 300–600 mg per day of standardized root extract. Starting at the lower end and observing tolerance is a reasonable approach. Dosage may differ by product concentration, so follow product labeling or professional guidance when available.

## Side Effects and Safety Considerations

Ashwagandha is generally well tolerated in short-term studies, though some people report gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, or drowsiness. It may interact with sedatives, thyroid medications, or immunosuppressants; individuals who are pregnant or breastfeeding are usually advised to avoid it until more safety data are available. Consulting a healthcare professional about interactions and contraindications is advisable.

## Should You Take It Daily?

Regular daily use has been associated with more consistent effects in clinical trials, particularly for stress reduction. Occasional use may provide transient benefits, but many reported advantages appear with sustained supplementation over several weeks. Individual goals, health status, and medication use should guide decisions about daily intake.

## Conclusion

Ashwagandha is a historically significant herb with growing scientific interest. Evidence supports potential benefits for stress management and some aspects of physical performance, with a generally favorable short-term safety profile. Careful product selection, appropriate dosing, and consultation with a healthcare professional will help ensure safe and informed use.
