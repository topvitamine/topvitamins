Maintaining optimal nutrient status is a cornerstone of preventive health. This concise, evidence-based guide outlines ten vitamins that commonly support core physiological functions—immunity, bone health, energy metabolism, and cellular repair—and explains practical ways to address common shortfalls in 2025.

Vitamin D: The sunshine vitamin is essential for calcium absorption and immune regulation. Serum 25(OH)D levels vary by geography and lifestyle; many adults in temperate regions benefit from supplementation, particularly in winter. Typical recommendations range from 600–800 IU/day for most adults, though higher doses may be appropriate under clinical supervision if deficiency is documented.

Vitamin C: A water-soluble antioxidant that supports connective tissue synthesis and immune cell function. Regular intake from citrus fruits and vegetables is ideal; supplements can help meet needs when dietary intake is low. Evidence suggests vitamin C can modestly reduce the duration of common colds in some populations when taken regularly.

Vitamin B12: Critical for red blood cell formation and neurological health. B12 is primarily found in animal products, so vegetarians, vegans, and older adults with reduced absorption should monitor levels. Typical supplemental doses for maintenance range from 2.4 mcg to higher oral or injectable doses when deficiency is present.

Vitamin A: Important for vision, mucosal integrity, and immune function. Preformed vitamin A (retinol) is found in animal sources, while provitamin A carotenoids come from plants. Because excess retinol can be toxic, many practitioners recommend meeting needs via beta-carotene-rich foods or appropriate multivitamin formulations rather than high-dose preformed vitamin A.

Vitamin E: A lipid-soluble antioxidant that protects cell membranes. Dietary sources include nuts and vegetable oils. When choosing supplements, natural d-alpha-tocopherol forms may have better bioavailability than some synthetic alternatives.

Vitamin K: Necessary for blood coagulation and bone metabolism. Leafy greens supply phylloquinone (K1); some gut bacteria produce menaquinones (K2). Adequate vitamin K supports proper calcium utilization in bones and vasculature. Typical intakes are around 90–120 mcg/day for adults.

Vitamin B6: Involved in amino acid metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis. Sufficient B6 supports mood regulation and metabolic processes. Dietary sources include poultry, fish, and starchy vegetables; common supplemental recommendations are in the 1.3–2 mg/day range for most adults.

Folate (Vitamin B9): Key for DNA synthesis and cell division; critical periconceptionally to reduce neural tube defect risk. Natural folate from leafy greens and legumes is beneficial, while folic acid supplements are commonly used to ensure adequate intake during pregnancy planning and early gestation (400 mcg/day recommended for most adults).

Biotin: A B-family vitamin that contributes to macronutrient metabolism and supports hair, skin, and nail health. Biotin-rich foods include eggs and whole grains; standard supplemental amounts are typically 30–100 mcg/day for maintenance.

Niacin (Vitamin B3): Supports energy metabolism and lipid profiles at therapeutic doses (which require medical oversight). Daily intakes for general health are around 14–16 mg for adults.

For practical implementation, combine a balanced diet with targeted supplementation based on individual risk factors (dietary patterns, age, sunlight exposure, medical history, and laboratory results).
