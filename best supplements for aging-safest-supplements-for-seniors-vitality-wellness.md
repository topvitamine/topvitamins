## Introduction

Maintaining vitality and wellness becomes increasingly important with age as energy, immune resilience, and nutrient absorption often decline. Dietary gaps are common among older adults because of reduced appetite, medication interactions, dental issues, or difficulty preparing balanced meals. Thoughtful supplementation can help fill nutritional shortfalls and support bone, brain, immune, and metabolic health when used carefully and under medical guidance.

This article summarizes evidence-based supplements commonly used by seniors, safety considerations, and resources to help evaluate product quality.

## Key supplements and why they matter

- **Vitamin D (D3):** Critical for calcium metabolism, muscle function, and immune health. Seniors commonly have low levels due to reduced skin synthesis and less outdoor activity. Typical recommendations for older adults start around 800–1000 IU/day, with higher doses only under clinical supervision and testing.

- **Vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin or hydroxycobalamin):** Absorption from food can decline with age and with certain medications. B12 supports nerve function and red blood cell production; deficiency can present as fatigue, cognitive changes, or neuropathy.

- **Calcium and Vitamin K2 (MK-7):** Calcium supports bone mass, while K2 helps direct calcium to bone rather than soft tissues. Both are often part of bone-support strategies alongside Vitamin D.

- **Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA):** Found in fish oil or algae-derived supplements, omega-3s support cognitive health, cardiovascular function, and may help mood regulation.

- **CoQ10 (ubiquinol):** A mitochondrial coenzyme that declines with age and can be depleted by statins; supplementation (100–200 mg/day) may support cellular energy and cardiovascular function.

- **Magnesium:** Important for neuromuscular function, sleep, and bone health. Forms such as magnesium glycinate are often better tolerated by older adults.

- **Probiotics and fiber:** To support gut health, nutrient absorption, and regularity, especially when digestive function is altered.

- **Targeted botanicals (curcumin, ginseng, rhodiola):** These can have anti-inflammatory or adaptogenic effects; evidence varies and safety depends on interactions with medications.

## Safety and practical guidance

- Consult a healthcare provider before starting supplements, especially when taking prescription medications. Interactions (for example, vitamin K with warfarin, or high-dose calcium affecting certain drugs) are clinically important.

- Prefer supplements with transparent sourcing and third-party testing for purity and potency. Review product certificates of analysis when available.

- Use lab testing when possible (e.g., vitamin D, B12, magnesium) to guide dosing rather than blanket high-dose supplementation.

- Prioritize food-first approaches: nutrient-dense meals remain the foundation of healthy aging, with supplements used to address specific deficits.
