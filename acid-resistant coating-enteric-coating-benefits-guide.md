# What is Enteric Coating?

Enteric coating is an acid-resistant layer applied to pills, capsules, and tablets to protect their contents from the stomach's highly acidic environment. Rather than dissolving immediately in the stomach, an enteric coating remains intact until the dosage form reaches the small intestine, where the pH is higher and the coating is designed to break down. This targeted release can preserve sensitive ingredients and improve how and where active compounds are absorbed.

## How enteric coating works

The digestive tract exhibits significant pH variation: the stomach typically has a low pH (about 1–3), while the small intestine ranges from roughly 5.5 to 7. Enteric coatings are usually made from polymers such as cellulose acetate phthalate or methacrylic acid copolymers. These materials are engineered to be insoluble in acidic conditions and to dissolve when exposed to near-neutral or mildly alkaline pH, thereby delaying release until the intestinal environment is reached.

This delayed-release mechanism is particularly useful for ingredients that are unstable in acid, or for substances that can irritate the gastric mucosa. By preventing disintegration in the stomach, enteric-coated formulations can maintain potency and reduce unwanted local effects.

## Evidence-based benefits

Key, evidence-aligned advantages of enteric coating include:

- Protection from stomach acid: Certain probiotics, enzymes, and vitamins can be denatured or degraded by gastric acid. An enteric barrier can maintain viability and activity until the intestine is reached.
- Improved absorption: Many nutrients and bioactives are absorbed primarily in the small intestine. Targeted release at that site can increase bioavailability compared with immediate-release forms that expose actives to stomach conditions.
- Reduced gastric irritation: Ingredients such as some nonsteroidal compounds or concentrated oils may cause discomfort if released in the stomach. Enteric coatings limit contact with the stomach lining and can alleviate such symptoms.

Clinical and formulation studies support these mechanisms, though the degree of benefit depends on the active ingredient, the quality of the coating, and individual physiological factors such as gastric emptying time.

## Enteric-coated vs. regular coated supplements

Not all coated supplements are enteric coated. Standard coatings often mask taste, improve swallowability, or provide mechanical protection; they dissolve in the stomach and do not offer acid resistance. Enteric coatings are specifically formulated to resist low pH and dissolve at higher pH, enabling site-specific delivery.

Supplements commonly benefiting from enteric coating include certain probiotics, some fish oil formulations, and acid-labile vitamins such as B12 in select cases. However, effectiveness depends on validated coating performance and appropriate testing.

## Choosing and learning more

When evaluating enteric-coated products, look for evidence of acid-resistance testing, clear ingredient disclosure, and manufacturing standards.

## Conclusion

Enteric coating is a formulation strategy that protects sensitive actives from stomach acid, can improve intestinal delivery and absorption, and may reduce gastric irritation. Its practical value depends on the ingredient in question and the quality of the coating, so evaluation should be evidence-based and product-specific.
