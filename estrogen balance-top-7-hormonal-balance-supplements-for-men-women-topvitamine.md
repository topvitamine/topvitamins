Hormonal balance is central to metabolism, mood, energy and reproductive health. When hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone and cortisol fall out of equilibrium, people can experience fatigue, mood changes, sleep disruption and metabolic shifts. Natural supplements can support endocrine function alongside lifestyle measures, and evidence supports specific nutrients and botanicals for targeted effects.

This concise guide summarizes seven supplements commonly used to support hormonal balance in both men and women. For a fuller overview, see the original review: [Top 7 Supplements for Hormonal Balance (For Men & Women)](https://www.topvitamine.com/blogs/news/top-7-hormonal-balance-supplements-for-men-women-topvitamine).

1) Maca root (Lepidium meyenii)
Maca is an adaptogenic plant traditionally used in Andean medicine. Clinical and observational studies suggest maca may reduce menopausal symptoms and support reproductive health, potentially by modulating estrogen-related pathways and improving subjective wellbeing and energy.

2) Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera)
Ashwagandha is an adaptogen with evidence for reducing perceived stress and lowering cortisol. In men, some trials report improvements in serum testosterone and muscle strength when ashwagandha is combined with resistance training. Its stress-mitigating effects can indirectly benefit broader hormonal balance.

3) Vitamin D
Vitamin D acts like a hormone and influences production and sensitivity of sex and thyroid hormones. Widespread insufficiency makes supplementation relevant for endocrine health.

4) Omega-3 fatty acids
EPA and DHA have anti-inflammatory effects that can improve insulin sensitivity and support brain pathways involved in mood regulation. Several studies link omega-3 intake with reduced inflammatory markers and improved metabolic outcomes relevant to hormonal regulation.

5) Probiotics
The gut microbiome participates in hormone metabolism, including enterohepatic circulation of estrogens. Probiotic interventions can favorably alter microbiome composition and support more efficient hormone metabolism and immune function.

6) Zinc
Zinc is essential for hormone synthesis and action; it supports testosterone production in men and helps regulate ovarian function in women. Zinc deficiency impairs immune responses and endocrine signaling, so maintaining adequate intake is important.

7) B vitamins (notably B6 and B12)
B vitamins support energy metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis and methylation pathways that affect hormone production and mood stability. Targets like B6 have specific roles in premenstrual symptom management.

Choosing supplements
Select third-party tested formulations and appropriate dosages. Professional guidance is recommended when combining supplements with prescription medications or when addressing specific endocrine disorders.

Lifestyle considerations
Diet, sleep, stress management and exercise have large effects on hormonal balance and should accompany any supplementation strategy. Strength training supports testosterone maintenance in men, while balanced micronutrient intake supports menstrual and menopausal transitions in women.
