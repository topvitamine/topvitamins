# How to Know If You're Vitamin D Deficient (And What to Do About It)

Vitamin D is essential for bone health, muscle function, and immune regulation. Many people worldwide have insufficient vitamin D without realizing it because symptoms are often nonspecific. This article reviews common causes, signs, diagnostic testing, and practical steps to address deficiency using an evidence-based approach.

## What is vitamin D deficiency?

Vitamin D deficiency means blood concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are lower than levels needed for optimal health. The most widely used threshold defines deficiency as levels below about 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), although different guidelines suggest varying targets for optimal status. Vitamin D facilitates calcium and phosphorus absorption; inadequate amounts can impair bone mineralization and contribute to musculoskeletal symptoms.

## Common causes

- Insufficient sunlight exposure: UVB radiation on skin produces vitamin D; limited outdoor time, higher latitudes, winter months, and extensive sunscreen use reduce synthesis.
- Dietary shortfalls: Few foods naturally contain vitamin D (fatty fish, egg yolks); fortified foods help but may not be enough alone.
- Malabsorption and medical conditions: Disorders such as celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, and certain liver or kidney diseases can impair vitamin D metabolism or absorption.
- Medications: Some anticonvulsants and glucocorticoids can alter vitamin D metabolism.
- Age and skin changes: Older adults and those with darker skin synthesize less vitamin D from the same sun exposure.

## Signs and symptoms

Symptoms are often subtle and develop gradually. Frequently reported issues include:

- Fatigue and general malaise
- Muscle weakness or aches
- Bone pain or tenderness
- Increased susceptibility to respiratory infections

In children, severe deficiency can cause rickets (impaired bone development). In adults, prolonged deficiency may contribute to osteomalacia and increased fracture risk.

## How to check: the blood test

The standard diagnostic measure is serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration. Clinicians order this test when patients have risk factors, unexplained musculoskeletal symptoms, or conditions affecting bone health. Interpretation of results should consider assay variability and clinical context.

## Management principles

- Confirm deficiency with a blood test before starting high-dose supplements.
- For many adults, maintenance doses in the range of 600–2,000 IU/day support sufficiency, but higher therapeutic doses may be used short-term under medical supervision when levels are low. The tolerable upper intake level for most adults is commonly cited as 4,000 IU/day, but individualized guidance is important.
- Prefer vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) for supplementation in many settings because it raises blood levels effectively; follow clinician recommendations and recheck levels after a few months of therapy.
- Address contributing factors: modify medications where possible, treat malabsorption disorders, and include dietary sources and safe sun exposure as appropriate.

## Prevention and follow-up

Regular monitoring for people at risk, seasonal adjustments to intake, and sensible sun exposure help maintain adequate vitamin D. Discuss testing frequency and target levels with a healthcare provider, particularly for older adults, those with chronic disease, or people on medications that affect vitamin D.
