<p>Dietary supplements are widely used to support nutrition and health, but rising demand has led to a growing market for counterfeit products. Fake supplements can be underdosed, contaminated, mislabeled, or entirely fraudulent, creating real risks to health. This article outlines key indicators of counterfeit supplements and practical steps to verify authenticity.</p>

<h2>Why Counterfeits Are a Growing Problem</h2>
<p>Counterfeiters exploit gaps in regulation and distribution, selling products through unverified online marketplaces, social media storefronts, and small retailers without traceable supply chains. These products may imitate trusted brands while omitting quality controls such as Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliance, third-party testing, and accurate labeling. The consequences range from ineffectiveness to contamination with heavy metals, bacteria, or undeclared pharmaceuticals.</p>

<h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
<p>Consumers can reduce risk by recognizing common warning signs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Label errors: misspellings, inconsistent fonts, or inaccurate ingredient names indicate low-quality production.</li>
  <li>Poor packaging: flimsy seals, smudged printing, or mismatched batch codes suggest repackaging or counterfeit manufacture.</li>
  <li>Unusual product characteristics: differences in color, smell, or tablet/capsule shape compared with official product images.</li>
  <li>Suspicious pricing: extremely low prices relative to market norms are a common marker of counterfeit goods.</li>
  <li>Unverified sellers: third-party sellers without clear authorization, or listings lacking manufacturer contact details.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Authenticity Entails</h2>
<p>Authentic supplements are produced under controlled conditions, list accurate ingredient amounts, and often provide third-party verification such as USP, NSF, or independent Certificates of Analysis (CoAs). Traceability features—batch numbers, expiry dates, and scannable QR codes linking to manufacturer verification—strengthen confidence in a product’s provenance.</p>

<h2>How to Check a Supplement Before Buying</h2>
<p>Use a quick checklist before purchasing: inspect the label and packaging, confirm expiration and batch codes, scan any QR code or barcode with a trusted verification app, and compare the product appearance to the manufacturer’s official images. Visit the manufacturer’s site to confirm authorized retailers and request CoAs or lab results when in doubt.
