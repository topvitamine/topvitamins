Healthy hair begins with adequate nutrition. Vitamins and minerals support the biological processes that produce and maintain hair, including follicle health, keratin production, and cell turnover. Deficiencies in key nutrients can lead to thinning, brittleness, and increased shedding. This article summarizes evidence-based vitamins and minerals linked to better hair health and how targeted supplements may help fill dietary gaps.

## Key vitamins and minerals for hair

Biotin (vitamin B7) is widely associated with hair health because it participates in keratin synthesis. Clinical improvements are most evident in individuals with biotin deficiency, where supplementation can increase hair thickness and reduce breakage. For those without deficiency, evidence for additional benefit is limited but biotin remains a common component of multi-nutrient hair formulas.

Vitamin D plays a role in hair follicle cycling. Low vitamin D status has been correlated with certain hair loss conditions and with delayed hair regrowth. Achieving sufficient vitamin D through sensible sun exposure, diet (e.g., fatty fish, fortified foods), or supplementation may support follicle function.

Vitamin E is an antioxidant that protects scalp tissues from oxidative stress. Some studies indicate topical or oral vitamin E can improve hair condition metrics by reducing oxidative damage and supporting microcirculation around follicles.

Vitamin C is critical for collagen synthesis, which helps maintain hair shaft structure. It also enhances non-heme iron absorption, indirectly supporting hair growth by improving iron bioavailability. Dietary sources include citrus fruits, berries, and peppers.

Iron and zinc are essential minerals for hair production and repair. Iron deficiency is a well-known contributor to hair thinning, particularly in premenopausal women. Zinc supports tissue growth and repair; low zinc levels can lead to hair shedding and a compromised scalp barrier.

## Combining nutrients for greater effect

Hair growth is multifactorial; combining several complementary vitamins and minerals often yields better results than single-nutrient approaches, especially when correcting deficiencies. Balanced formulations typically include B vitamins, vitamins D, C, and E, plus iron and zinc at evidence-informed doses. When considering supplements, base choices on laboratory-confirmed deficiencies or dietary insufficiencies and consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.

## Practical tips to support hair with nutrition

A varied diet rich in lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains supports hair structure and nutrient status. Hydration, stress management, and adequate sleep also influence hair health and nutrient metabolism. Minimize excessive heat styling and harsh chemical treatments to reduce mechanical and chemical damage to hair fibers.

## Summary

Biotin, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin C, iron, and zinc each have a physiologic role in hair maintenance. Addressing deficiencies and ensuring a balanced intake of these nutrients can help maintain healthy hair.
