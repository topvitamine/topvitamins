<p>As supplement use grows globally, so does the circulation of counterfeit products that mimic legitimate vitamins and formulations. Fake supplements can contain contaminants, incorrect dosages, or no active ingredients at all — posing real health risks. This guide outlines practical, evidence-based steps to evaluate supplement authenticity and minimize exposure to harmful products.</p>

<h2>Inspect Packaging and Label Details</h2>
<p>Start with a close visual inspection. Genuine products typically have consistent, high-quality printing and tamper-evident seals. Check for a clearly printed batch or lot number and an expiration date; missing or smudged information is a red flag. Avoid items with vague ingredient listings such as “proprietary blend” where amounts are not specified. Look for allergen statements, storage instructions, and manufacturer contact details — their absence reduces traceability.</p>

<h2>Verify Third-Party Testing and Certifications</h2>
<p>Third-party verification strengthens confidence in a product’s content and manufacturing standards. Recognized marks such as USP, NSF International, or Informed Sport suggest independent testing for purity and label accuracy. Where available, review certificates of analysis (CoAs) or QR codes that link to batch-specific test results. Be cautious of counterfeit seals or logos; verify any certification on the certifier’s official site.</p>

<h2>Research Source and Supply Chain</h2>
<p>Purchase from reputable retailers and official brand channels when possible. Cross-check the brand’s website for product pages and manufacturer information.

<h2>Price, Availability, and Claims</h2>
<p>While low prices can be attractive, unusually deep discounts or listings on unverified third-party marketplaces increase the likelihood of counterfeit products. Be wary of exaggerated health claims that promise rapid or miraculous results; regulated health claims require scientific substantiation. If a product’s performance sounds too good to be true, it often is.</p>

<h2>When in Doubt: Lab Testing and Professional Advice</h2>
<p>If you suspect a product may be counterfeit — unusual appearance, adverse reactions, or conflicting batch information — stop use and consult a healthcare professional. Some consumers seek independent laboratory testing for critical supplements.
