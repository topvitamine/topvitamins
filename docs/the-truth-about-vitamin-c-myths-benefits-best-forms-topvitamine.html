Vitamin C is a well-studied nutrient with clear physiological roles, but popular claims can blur fact and fiction. This concise, evidence-based overview explains what vitamin C does, common myths, natural sources, different supplement forms, and practical dosage guidance.

## What is vitamin C?

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a water-soluble vitamin humans must obtain from diet or supplements. It functions as an antioxidant, supports collagen synthesis, and helps immune cell function. Because it is water-soluble, the body does not store large amounts, so regular intake is important.

## Key benefits supported by evidence

- Immune support: Vitamin C supports multiple components of the immune response and can reduce the duration and severity of common cold symptoms when taken regularly, though it does not reliably prevent colds in the general population.
- Skin and collagen: As a required cofactor for collagen synthesis, vitamin C contributes to wound healing and skin structure.
- Antioxidant protection: It neutralizes reactive molecules and helps regenerate other antioxidants, contributing to cellular protection.
- Iron absorption and cardiovascular support: Vitamin C enhances non-heme iron absorption from plant foods and may support blood vessel function through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.

## Common myths

- Myth: Mega-doses prevent colds. Evidence shows routine supplementation can shorten colds modestly; very high single doses do not guarantee prevention.
- Myth: All supplements are the same. Formulation matters — some products include bioflavonoids or are buffered for stomach comfort, while liposomal preparations aim to improve bioavailability.
- Myth: Only citrus provides vitamin C. Many fruits and vegetables are excellent sources, including bell peppers, kiwi, strawberries, guava, broccoli, and leafy greens.

## Natural sources

A varied diet provides vitamin C along with fiber and other micronutrients. Top sources include citrus fruits, strawberries, kiwi, guava, bell peppers, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and spinach. Cooking can reduce vitamin C content, so raw or lightly cooked produce preserves more.

## Types of supplements and choosing one

Common supplement forms include:

- Ascorbic acid: the most researched and effective form for most people.
- Buffered vitamin C (ascorbate salts): combined with minerals like calcium or magnesium to reduce acidity and improve tolerability for sensitive stomachs.
- Liposomal vitamin C: vitamin C encapsulated in lipid vesicles aiming for higher cellular uptake; evidence is still emerging but shows promise in some contexts.

When choosing products, look for third-party quality certification and clear ingredient lists.

## Dosage and safety

Recommended daily intake for adults is generally 75–90 mg; smokers and those under chronic stress may need more. Avoid exceeding the tolerable upper intake level of 2000 mg per day to reduce risk of gastrointestinal upset and potential kidney stone formation in susceptible individuals.

## Summary

Vitamin C supports immune function, skin health, antioxidant defense, and iron absorption. Prioritize dietary sources, understand different supplement forms, and follow evidence-based dosage limits to maximize benefits while minimizing risks.</body></html>
