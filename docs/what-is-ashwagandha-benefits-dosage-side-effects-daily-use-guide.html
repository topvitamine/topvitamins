Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is an herb used for millennia in Ayurvedic medicine. Often described as an adaptogen, it is believed to help the body regulate and respond to stressors rather than treating a single symptom. Traditionally the root and berries are used; modern supplements typically contain standardized root extracts.

## What Is Ashwagandha?

Ashwagandha has a long history in South Asian herbal practice and has attracted scientific attention for its potential to modulate stress hormones, support energy, and provide antioxidant effects. Mechanistically, compounds in the root—such as withanolides—are thought to influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and immune signaling, although research is ongoing to clarify the precise pathways.

## Ashwagandha Benefits

- Stress and anxiety relief: Randomized trials have reported reductions in perceived stress and lower cortisol levels in people taking standardized Ashwagandha extract compared with placebo.
- Energy and endurance: Some studies suggest improvements in subjective energy and exercise performance metrics, likely linked to reduced fatigue and better recovery.
- Immune and antioxidant support: Laboratory and small clinical studies indicate antioxidant activity and modulation of immune markers, which may support general resilience.

Evidence varies by outcome and study quality; benefits are often modest and more pronounced with standardized, clinically tested extracts taken consistently over weeks.

## How to Take Ashwagandha

Ashwagandha is available as capsules, powders, and liquid extracts. Capsules offer consistent dosing; powders can be mixed into beverages; tinctures provide an alternative for those who avoid pills. Timing can be individualized: some people prefer morning dosing for sustained daytime energy, while others take it at night to support sleep. Regardless of timing, consistent daily use over several weeks typically produces the clearest effects.

## Ashwagandha Dosage

Clinical research commonly uses 300–600 mg per day of a standardized root extract, often given in divided doses. Starting at the lower end and monitoring response is prudent, especially for people taking other medications or with health conditions. Always follow product labeling and consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.

## Ashwagandha Side Effects and Safety

Ashwagandha is generally well tolerated at recommended dosages. Reported adverse effects are usually mild and may include stomach upset, diarrhea, and drowsiness. People who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have autoimmune disease, thyroid disorders, or are taking sedatives or immunosuppressants should consult a clinician before use. Interactions with thyroid medications and sedatives have been reported, so medical review is advised.

## Conclusion

Ashwagandha shows promise for stress modulation, energy support, and antioxidant effects when used consistently in standardized doses. Consider starting at a low dose, monitor your response, and seek medical advice if you have underlying conditions or take prescription medications. Evidence-based choice of formulation and dosing helps maximize potential benefits while minimizing risk.
