Zinc is a trace mineral required by every cell in the body and is involved in many physiological processes. Although needed in relatively small amounts, zinc benefits span immune function, tissue repair, growth, and enzymatic reactions. Because the body has limited zinc storage, regular dietary intake or supplementation may be necessary to maintain adequate levels.

## What is zinc and how it works

Zinc acts as a cofactor for over 300 enzymes that influence metabolism, DNA synthesis, and cell division. It supports immune responses by helping to activate T-cells and other defense mechanisms. Zinc also contributes to skin integrity and wound healing through effects on collagen synthesis and inflammation modulation.

## Key health benefits

- Immune support: Adequate zinc intake helps maintain normal immune surveillance and may shorten the duration or severity of some infections when used appropriately.
- Skin and wound healing: Zinc influences cell proliferation and inflammation, making it relevant for repair and certain dermatological conditions.
- Growth and development: Zinc is essential for normal growth, especially during infancy, childhood, and adolescence when cell division and tissue synthesis are rapid.
- Sensory function: Zinc contributes to taste and smell; deficiency can impair these senses.

## Recognizing zinc deficiency

Zinc deficiency symptoms can be nonspecific but commonly include frequent infections, delayed wound healing, hair loss, and altered taste or smell. In populations with limited dietary diversity, low zinc bioavailability (for example, from high-phytate diets) can increase deficiency risk. Clinical assessment and dietary review are important for diagnosis.

## Dietary sources and absorption

Good food sources of zinc include oysters, red meat, poultry, pumpkin seeds, lentils, and chickpeas. Animal-based sources generally provide zinc with higher bioavailability than plant sources. Combining plant-based zinc sources with strategies to reduce phytate content (soaking, fermentation) can improve absorption.

## Supplements: forms and considerations

Zinc supplements are available in several forms (zinc gluconate, zinc picolinate, zinc citrate) with similar overall efficacy for addressing mild deficiency. Typical adult requirements range around 8–11 mg per day, but specific needs vary by age, sex, pregnancy, and health status. Long-term high-dose zinc can interfere with copper absorption and should be managed under clinical guidance.

## Summary

Zinc is a multifunctional micronutrient important for immune competence, tissue repair, growth, and sensory function. Prioritizing zinc-rich foods supports nutrient adequacy, and supplements can be useful when dietary intake is insufficient or needs change. Clinical evaluation is recommended when symptoms of deficiency are present or before starting prolonged high-dose supplementation.
