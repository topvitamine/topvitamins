<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Blood tests inform clinical decisions and monitoring, but supplement intake can change biomarker readings. Understanding which supplements to avoid before a draw, which are generally safe, and how to reintroduce nutrients afterward helps ensure accurate results and appropriate follow-up.</p>

<h2>Before the Test: Key Principles</h2>

<p>Follow lab and clinician instructions first. In general, avoid introducing large or new doses in the 24–72 hours before testing. Short-term “booster” doses can transiently alter serum concentrations of water-soluble vitamins, while fat-soluble vitamins and some botanicals can affect assays for days.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pause high-dose biotin at least 72 hours before tests that include thyroid, hormone, or cardiac markers.</li>
  <li>Avoid fish oil and other oil-based supplements 12–24 hours prior to lipid panels.</li>
  <li>Hold multivitamins, iron, and herbal extracts when fasting labs are required, unless your clinician advises otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Supplements and Their Effects</h2>

<p>Vitamin D is commonly measured; consistent daily dosing over weeks yields a more reliable status than a single dose. For B12 and other water-soluble vitamins, consider withholding supplements for 12–24 hours if the goal is to diagnose deficiency. Herbal supplements such as ginkgo, garlic, turmeric, and ginseng may affect coagulation or liver enzymes and are best paused 48 hours before testing.</p>

<p>Biotin interference is well-documented for several immunoassays, and even moderate supplemental doses can cause misleading results.

<h2>Fasting Tests: What’s Generally Safe</h2>

<p>During fasting, non-caloric electrolytes (without sugars or flavorings) and plain water are acceptable. Magnesium supplements in non-caloric forms are usually safe unless serum magnesium is being measured. Skip caloric or oil-based supplements, including most multivitamins and omega-3 capsules, to avoid altering lipid or glucose-related measurements.</p>

<h2>After the Draw: Replenishment and Next Steps</h2>

<p>After the blood draw you may resume most supplements immediately unless your provider instructs otherwise. Rehydrate and consider gentle reintroduction of B-complex, vitamin C, and electrolyte support if you fasted or felt lightheaded. If testing revealed deficiencies or imbalances, use results to guide duration and dose rather than short-term escalation.</p>

<h2>Final Notes</h2>

<p>Decide whether your goal is to detect deficiency or to monitor treatment before altering supplement use. If the objective is diagnostic clarity, a short pause (24–72 hours) for certain supplements reduces the risk of misleading results.
