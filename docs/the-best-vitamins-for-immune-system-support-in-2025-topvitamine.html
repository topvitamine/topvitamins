Maintaining a resilient immune system remains a public health priority in 2025. Nutrients such as vitamins and minerals support the development and activity of immune cells, modulate inflammation, and protect tissues from oxidative stress. This article summarizes evidence-based roles for key vitamins and minerals, practical dietary sources, and complementary approaches to support immunity in a balanced way. For a concise overview, see [Topvitamine's review of immune-support vitamins](https://www.topvitamine.com/blogs/news/the-best-vitamins-for-immune-system-support-in-2025-topvitamine).

## Core immune-supporting vitamins and minerals

Vitamin C: Ascorbic acid is involved in the function of several immune cell types and acts as an antioxidant. Controlled trials suggest vitamin C can reduce the duration of common colds in some populations, and dietary intake from fruits and vegetables (e.g., citrus, strawberries, bell peppers, broccoli) contributes to plasma levels.

Zinc: Zinc is essential for innate and adaptive immunity, including neutrophil and natural killer cell activity and T-cell function. Zinc deficiency impairs immune responses; supplementation can be beneficial when deficiency is present. Common supplemental forms include zinc gluconate and zinc picolinate, which are generally well tolerated.

Vitamin D: Vitamin D receptors are expressed on immune cells, and vitamin D influences immune regulation and antimicrobial peptide production. Observational studies link low vitamin D status to increased susceptibility to respiratory infections; randomized trials suggest supplementation may reduce risk in deficient individuals. Sunlight exposure, fortified foods, and supplements are common sources.

Vitamin B6 and Selenium: Vitamin B6 supports antibody production and cellular immune responses. Selenium is a trace mineral with antioxidant properties that contributes to immune defense. Adequate dietary intake from varied sources (e.g., poultry, fish, legumes, nuts, whole grains) typically supports these nutrient needs.

## Complementary natural strategies

Gut health is closely connected to immune function. Probiotics—live microorganisms that can support a healthy microbiome—have been associated with modest reductions in upper respiratory tract infections in some studies. Herbal antioxidants such as elderberry, echinacea, and green tea polyphenols have traditional use and emerging evidence for short-term symptom relief, though study quality varies.

## Practical advice for 2025

1. Prioritize a nutrient-dense diet: Emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats to supply a broad range of immune-related nutrients.
2. Assess and correct deficiencies: Testing for vitamin D and reviewing dietary zinc intake can guide targeted supplementation when needed.
3. Consider tolerability and form: Choose supplement formulations with demonstrated bioavailability and minimal gastrointestinal side effects when supplementation is indicated.
4. Combine with lifestyle measures: Regular physical activity, adequate sleep, stress management, and avoiding excessive alcohol strengthen immune resilience.

## Limitations and safety

Supplements can correct deficiencies but are not a substitute for a balanced diet. Excessive intakes (for example, high-dose zinc or vitamin A) can cause adverse effects. Individuals should consult healthcare professionals before beginning high-dose regimens, especially if taking medications or managing chronic conditions.

Overall, a combination of adequate nutrient intake, sensible supplementation when indicated, and lifestyle measures provides a balanced, evidence-informed approach to supporting immune function in 2025.
