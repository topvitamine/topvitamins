Maintaining eye health is important for daily function and quality of life. With increased screen time and environmental stressors, people often look to nutritional strategies that can help protect vision and slow age-related decline. This article summarizes the evidence for common eye health supplements and practical considerations for their use.

## Common eye conditions and the role of nutrients

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cataracts and dry eye are among the conditions that most commonly affect adults. AMD impairs central vision and is a leading cause of vision loss in older adults, while dry eye causes discomfort and visual disturbance, particularly for those who use digital devices for long periods. Nutrition cannot cure these conditions, but specific nutrients have been associated with reduced risk or slower progression in clinical studies.

## Key ingredients supported by evidence

- Lutein and zeaxanthin: These carotenoids concentrate in the macula and filter high-energy blue light. Randomized trials and cohort studies indicate that higher dietary or supplemental intakes are associated with improved macular pigment density and may reduce progression of early AMD.

- Vitamins A, C and E: Vitamin A (retinol and provitamin A carotenoids) is essential for photoreceptor function and low-light vision. Vitamins C and E act as antioxidants that protect ocular tissues from oxidative stress; some long-term studies suggest modest benefits on cataract prevention and slowing macular degeneration when combined with other nutrients.

- Zinc: Zinc is involved in retinal metabolism and transport of vitamin A from the liver to the retina. It has been included in major AMD supplement formulas and appears to contribute to observed benefits in some clinical trials.

- Omega-3 fatty acids: EPA and DHA are structural components of retinal cell membranes and have anti-inflammatory properties. Evidence for omega-3 supplements shows mixed results for AMD but clearer benefits for dry eye symptoms in several randomized controlled trials.

## Practical guidance for choosing supplements

Dosage and formulation matter. Many clinical trials use specific doses or combinations (for example, AREDS/AREDS2 formulations for AMD), so matching those regimens is often recommended when targeting AMD risk. For general ocular support, look for products that supply lutein and zeaxanthin together with antioxidant vitamins and zinc, and consider omega-3s for dry eye management.

When possible, prioritize nutrients from a varied diet rich in leafy greens, colorful vegetables, citrus fruits, nuts and fatty fish; supplements are best used to fill gaps or target specific risk profiles.

## Safety and clinical considerations

Discuss supplementation with a healthcare professional, especially if you have preexisting conditions, take medications, or are planning to use high-dose formulations. Some nutrients (for example, high-dose vitamin A or zinc) can have adverse effects or interact with medications.

## Summary

Lutein, zeaxanthin, vitamins A, C, E, zinc and omega-3s are the most consistently studied nutrients for eye health. Evidence supports their role in retinal protection, macular pigment augmentation and symptomatic relief for dry eye. Use supplements to complement, not replace, a nutrient-rich diet and consult a clinician for individualized recommendations.
