Omega‑3 supplements are widely used to support cardiovascular, cognitive, and joint health. Quality, purity, and dose of EPA and DHA are the main factors that determine a fish oil’s likely benefit. This article compares Now Foods and Healthy Origins to help you evaluate which product may better match your needs.

## Brand overview

Now Foods is an established supplement manufacturer known for broad product lines and accessible pricing. The company emphasizes good manufacturing practices and a history of third‑party testing. Healthy Origins positions itself on careful sourcing and transparency, often highlighting independent lab results and purity-focused processing.

## Sourcing, purity, and testing

Both brands typically derive oil from cold‑water species such as anchovies and sardines, which tend to provide higher natural concentrations of EPA and DHA and lower contaminant burdens than some larger fish. Now Foods commonly uses multi‑step purification to reduce heavy metals and other impurities. Healthy Origins often reports using molecular distillation, a refinement method that targets mercury, PCBs, and other contaminants.

Certificates of analysis and third‑party testing are common features for both brands, and these reports are useful tools for assessing batch‑level purity and potency. When comparing fish oils, look for documentation on heavy metals, PCBs, and oxidation markers (peroxide and anisidine values) in addition to EPA/DHA content.

## EPA and DHA content

EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) are the principal long‑chain omega‑3s associated with anti‑inflammatory effects and neurocardiovascular benefits. Now Foods omega‑3 offerings typically provide about 500 mg of combined EPA+DHA per serving, whereas Healthy Origins formulations often present slightly higher combined doses, sometimes near 600 mg per serving. Higher amounts of EPA/DHA can increase the likelihood of clinically meaningful effects for conditions where dose matters, but individual needs vary.

## Formulation and absorption

Absorption can be influenced by the molecular form of the oil. Triglyceride‑form fish oils are generally reported to have better bioavailability than ethyl ester forms; Now Foods often uses triglyceride‑form oils, and Healthy Origins emphasizes refinement techniques intended to preserve bioavailability. For people with sensitive digestion, minor differences in form or capsule design can affect tolerability.

## Consumer feedback and practical considerations

User reviews for both brands are largely positive, frequently noting perceived improvements in joint comfort, mood stability, and overall well‑being. Common practical differences include capsule size, perceived aftertaste, and price per serving. Now Foods tends to be more budget‑friendly, while Healthy Origins may offer higher EPA/DHA per serving at a slightly higher price.

## Evidence‑based takeaway

Both Now Foods and Healthy Origins produce fish oil products that meet basic standards for sourcing, purification, and third‑party testing. If budget and broad availability are primary concerns, Now Foods is a reasonable choice; if higher EPA/DHA per serving is your priority, Healthy Origins may be preferable. Regardless of brand, check third‑party test results, EPA/DHA content per serving, and oxidation values when possible.
