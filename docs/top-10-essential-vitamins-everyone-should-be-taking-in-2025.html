Maintaining adequate vitamin intake supports immunity, metabolic function, bone health, and cognitive performance. This concise, evidence-based overview summarizes ten vitamins commonly recommended for adults, how they contribute to health, and practical considerations for supplementation in 2025.

Vitamin D: Known as the sunshine vitamin, vitamin D aids calcium absorption and supports immune regulation. Natural sources include fatty fish and fortified foods, but limited sun exposure or seasonal changes often necessitate supplementation. Typical adult recommendations range from 600–800 IU daily, with individualized doses based on serum 25(OH)D levels.

Vitamin C: A water-soluble antioxidant, vitamin C contributes to collagen synthesis, immune cell function, and protection against oxidative stress. Citrus fruits, peppers, and berries are rich sources. Regular dietary intake of vitamin C supports recovery and tissue repair; supplemental doses are commonly used when dietary intake is insufficient.

Vitamin B12: Essential for red blood cell formation and neurological function, B12 is primarily found in animal-derived foods. Vegetarians, older adults, and those with malabsorption may require supplementation. Clinical assessment and blood tests help determine appropriate dosing.

Vitamin A: Important for vision, epithelial integrity, and immune responses. Vitamin A occurs as preformed retinol in animal products and as provitamin A carotenoids (e.g., beta-carotene) in plants. Care is needed to avoid excessive preformed vitamin A; beta-carotene is a safer precursor for many individuals.

Vitamin E: A lipid-soluble antioxidant that protects cell membranes from oxidative damage. Dietary sources include nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils. When choosing supplements, natural forms (d-alpha-tocopherol) typically have higher bioactivity than some synthetic forms.

Vitamin K: Plays a central role in blood clotting and in the regulation of bone mineralization by modulating calcium-binding proteins. Leafy greens are the primary dietary source. Many guidelines suggest 90–120 mcg daily for adults, though individual needs vary.

Vitamin B6: Involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, amino acid metabolism, and hemoglobin production. Good food sources include poultry, fish, and starchy vegetables. Typical intake recommendations for adults are around 1.3–2 mg per day.

Folate (Vitamin B9): Required for DNA synthesis and cell division, with special importance during preconception and early pregnancy to reduce neural tube defect risk. Dietary folate and supplemental folic acid both contribute; adult recommendations are generally 400 mcg daily for non-pregnant adults.

Biotin: A B-vitamin that supports keratin infrastructure in hair, skin, and nails and functions as a coenzyme in carboxylation reactions. Biotin occurs in eggs, nuts, and whole grains; supplemental biotin is commonly used for specific deficiencies or clinical indications.

Niacin (Vitamin B3): Supports energy metabolism, skin integrity, and lipid profiles. Adequate dietary intake typically comes from poultry, lean meats, and nuts, with recommended daily amounts around 14–16 mg for most adults. High-dose niacin should only be taken under medical supervision.

Practical considerations: prioritize obtaining nutrients from diverse whole foods, screen for deficiencies when symptoms or risk factors exist, and tailor supplementation to individual needs and laboratory findings. When choosing products, seek third-party testing and clear dosage information. Integrating dietary strategies with appropriate supplementation and periodic monitoring helps maintain nutrient sufficiency and supports long-term health.
