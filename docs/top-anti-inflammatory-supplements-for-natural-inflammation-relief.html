Inflammation is a normal immune response that helps the body heal after injury or infection. When inflammation becomes persistent, however, it can contribute to chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, and arthritis. Dietary supplements can offer targeted, natural support to help reduce inflammatory markers when used alongside diet and lifestyle measures.

## Common anti-inflammatory supplements and evidence

Curcumin (turmeric extract)

Curcumin, the main bioactive in turmeric, has been widely studied for its anti-inflammatory effects. Randomized controlled trials show benefits for joint pain and markers of systemic inflammation when high-bioavailability formulations are used. Typical supplement ranges are 500–2,000 mg per day, often divided. Absorption improves when combined with black pepper extract (piperine) or specialized delivery systems.

Omega-3 fatty acids

Omega-3s (EPA and DHA) from fish oil decrease production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines. Evidence supports benefits for cardiovascular health and reduction of joint stiffness. Dietary sources include fatty fish; supplements often provide concentrated EPA/DHA. A common supplemental target for inflammation support is around 1,000 mg combined EPA+DHA daily, but therapeutic doses may be higher under clinical guidance.

Ginger

Ginger contains gingerols and related compounds that inhibit inflammatory pathways. Clinical studies support ginger’s role in reducing muscle soreness and some arthritic symptoms. Typical supplemental doses range from 1,000 to 2,000 mg of standardized extract per day, or use culinary ginger and teas for milder effects.

Boswellia serrata

Boswellia, a resin used in traditional medicine, inhibits enzymes involved in inflammation and can reduce joint swelling and pain. Research suggests doses of 300–500 mg two to three times daily of a standardized extract may be effective for osteoarthritis and related conditions.

Probiotics and gut health

The gut microbiome influences systemic inflammation. Specific probiotic strains (e.g., Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium) can modulate immune responses and reduce gut-derived inflammatory signaling. Daily intake of a quality probiotic or fermented foods supports gut barrier function and overall inflammation control.

## Choosing supplements responsibly

Prioritize products with transparent ingredient lists, third-party testing, and standardized extracts. Consider potential interactions with medications (for example, high-dose fish oil can affect blood clotting; curcumin may interact with anticoagulants). Consult a healthcare professional before starting new supplements, particularly if you have chronic health conditions or take prescription drugs.

## Lifestyle context

Supplements work best as part of a broader approach: an anti-inflammatory diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats; regular physical activity; adequate sleep; and stress management.
