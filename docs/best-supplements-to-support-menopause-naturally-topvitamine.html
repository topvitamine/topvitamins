Menopause is a normal life stage accompanied by symptoms such as hot flashes, sleep disturbance, mood changes, and bone density loss. Many women explore non-prescription options to relieve symptoms or support overall health. This article reviews commonly used supplements, summarizes evidence for benefits and risks, and suggests considerations for safer use.

## Understanding menopause and symptom targets

Menopause results from declines in ovarian estrogen and progesterone production. Symptoms vary in type and severity; common targets for supplements include vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes), mood and sleep, and bone health. Evidence quality varies by ingredient; some show modest benefit in randomized trials, while others rely on traditional use or smaller studies.

## Herbal supplements with clinical evidence

- Black cohosh: Several randomized trials suggest black cohosh extracts can modestly reduce frequency and severity of hot flashes for some women. Effects appear greatest with standardized extracts over weeks to months. Monitoring liver function is advised in prolonged use.

- Red clover: Red clover contains isoflavones (phytoestrogens). Meta-analyses find mixed results; some studies report reductions in hot flashes and minor bone density benefits, while others show no clear effect. Tolerability is generally good, but benefits are usually modest.

- Dong quai: Used traditionally in East Asian medicine for gynecologic symptoms, evidence for menopausal symptom relief is limited and inconsistent. It may have mild anti-inflammatory effects but should be used cautiously with anticoagulant medications.

## Vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients

- Vitamin E: Some small studies indicate vitamin E may slightly reduce hot flash intensity, though effects are smaller than pharmacologic options. As an antioxidant, it may support skin and cellular health.

- B vitamins: B-complex vitamins can support energy metabolism and nervous system function; they may help with fatigue and mood when deficiencies are present.

- Calcium and vitamin D: Robust evidence supports calcium and vitamin D for bone health, particularly when combined with weight-bearing exercise. These nutrients are preventive rather than immediate symptom relievers.

- Omega-3 fatty acids and herbal adaptogens (e.g., maca, chasteberry): Preliminary evidence suggests potential mood and hormonal-support effects, but higher-quality trials are needed.

## Safety considerations and interactions

Supplements can cause side effects such as gastrointestinal upset, headaches, or allergic reactions. Certain herbs interact with medications (e.g., anticoagulants, hormone therapies) or are contraindicated in specific medical conditions. Quality and standardization of herbal extracts vary across products; choosing verified formulations and consulting a healthcare professional before starting any regimen is important.

## Conclusion

Some herbal and nutrient supplements show modest benefits for menopausal symptoms or bone health, but results are variable. Decisions should be individualized, based on symptom burden, medical history, and potential interactions. Consulting a healthcare professional and choosing quality products helps reduce risks and supports informed use of natural therapies during menopause.
