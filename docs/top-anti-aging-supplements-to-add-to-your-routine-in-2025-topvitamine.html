Aging is a gradual biological process that affects skin quality, energy metabolism, and disease risk. While no supplement can stop aging, targeted nutrients and natural compounds can support cellular repair, reduce oxidative stress, and modulate inflammation—three processes closely linked to aging. This article summarizes evidence-based supplements and considerations for incorporating them safely into a routine.

## Key natural ingredients with evidence

- Collagen peptides: Collagen is the primary structural protein of skin and connective tissue. Oral collagen peptides have been associated in trials with modest improvements in skin elasticity and reduced wrinkle depth by providing amino acids that support dermal repair.

- Hyaluronic acid: Important for skin hydration and extracellular matrix integrity, hyaluronic acid supplements can improve skin moisture and temporary fullness, especially when combined with other skin-supporting nutrients.

- Antioxidants (vitamins C and E, polyphenols): Oxidative damage from free radicals contributes to collagen degradation and age-related skin changes. Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis; vitamin E and polyphenols such as green tea extract and resveratrol neutralize free radicals and support photoprotection.

- Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): A cellular antioxidant involved in mitochondrial energy production. Supplementation can help counteract age-associated declines in endogenous CoQ10 and may support cardiovascular and cellular energy measures.

## Anti-inflammatory and omega-3 compounds

Chronic low-grade inflammation accelerates tissue aging. Curcumin (from turmeric) shows anti-inflammatory effects in multiple studies and can lower systemic inflammatory markers. Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA) have established anti-inflammatory benefits, support cardiovascular and brain health, and may improve skin barrier function.

## Longevity-associated vitamins

- Vitamin D: Important for bone, immune, and muscle health. Many adults have insufficient levels; maintaining adequate vitamin D is associated with better health outcomes in older populations.

- B vitamins (B6, B12, folate): Support energy metabolism and cellular repair; B12 and folate are especially relevant to neurological health and homocysteine regulation.

## Practical advice for use

- Consistency and context matter: Many benefits emerge after weeks to months of regular use, and supplements are most effective when paired with balanced nutrition, physical activity, sleep, and sun protection.

- Absorption considerations: Some nutrients are better absorbed with meals (fat-soluble vitamins, CoQ10, curcumin with a fat source). Liposomal delivery systems can improve bioavailability for certain compounds; see research on liposomal vitamin C for absorption benefits (<a href="https://topvitamine.github.io/topvitamins/liposomal-capsules-benefits-explained">liposomal vitamin C benefits</a>).

- Allergies and product selection: For those with sensitivities, allergen-free formulations reduce risk. Review labels for gluten-, dairy-, or soy-free certifications and consider third-party testing for purity. For broader context on supplement formulation choices, see an iron supplement comparison that discusses formulation tolerability (<a href="https://topvitamine.github.io/topvitamins/iron-supplement-guide-ferrous-sulfate-vs-gentle-chelates-topvitamine">iron supplement guide</a>).

- Safety and interactions: Discuss new supplements with a healthcare professional, especially when taking medications or managing chronic conditions. Evidence supports benefits for many of the nutrients above, but individual needs vary.
