Vitamin C is an essential nutrient involved in antioxidant defense, collagen production and immune support. In addition to dietary sources such as citrus fruits, berries and vegetables, supplements are widely used to maintain adequate intake. One supplement form that has attracted interest is liposomal vitamin C, which uses lipid-based carriers to deliver ascorbic acid. This article reviews how liposomal vitamin C works, compares it with traditional forms, and outlines who may benefit most.

## How liposomal vitamin C works

Liposomal vitamin C encloses ascorbic acid within microscopic phospholipid vesicles called liposomes. Phospholipids are structural components of cell membranes, so liposomes can fuse with biological membranes and potentially protect the vitamin from degradation in the gastrointestinal tract. The proposed advantage is that the encapsulated vitamin reaches the bloodstream more intact and is released gradually, which can increase circulating concentrations relative to some unencapsulated forms.

## Liposomal vs. regular vitamin C: absorption and bioavailability

Oral ascorbic acid is water-soluble and absorbed in the small intestine by active transport and passive diffusion. At higher doses, absorption efficiency declines and unabsorbed vitamin C can cause gastrointestinal symptoms. Liposomal formulations aim to bypass some limitations by facilitating transport across membranes and reducing exposure to stomach acid.

Controlled comparative studies are limited but suggest that liposomal encapsulation can increase measured plasma ascorbate levels in some contexts. However, results vary with dose, formulation quality and individual factors. The term “bioavailability” encompasses absorption, distribution and cellular uptake; liposomal forms may improve one or more of these aspects, but evidence quality is heterogeneous.

## Potential benefits and limitations

Potential benefits
- Higher plasma levels in some studies, which may translate to improved antioxidant capacity.
- Reduced gastrointestinal side effects at equivalent nominal doses, owing to different absorption kinetics.

Limitations and considerations
- Clinical outcome data (e.g., symptom improvement or disease prevention) remain limited; most evidence focuses on pharmacokinetics.
- Product quality varies. Phospholipid source, liposome stability and manufacturing processes affect performance.
- Cost per dose can be higher than generic ascorbic acid.

## Who might consider liposomal vitamin C?

Liposomal vitamin C may be of interest to people who have difficulty tolerating high oral doses of sodium ascorbate or ascorbic acid, those with malabsorption issues, or individuals seeking a potentially higher circulating ascorbate level from oral supplementation. Athletes and older adults are groups commonly interested in optimized nutrient delivery, though clinical benefits should be assessed on an individual basis.

## Summary

Liposomal vitamin C offers a plausible mechanism to improve ascorbate delivery through phospholipid encapsulation and has shown increased plasma levels in some studies. However, clinical outcome evidence is limited and product quality matters. Those considering this form should weigh potential tolerability and absorption benefits against cost and the current state of evidence, and discuss supplementation with a healthcare professional if they have specific health conditions or take medications.
