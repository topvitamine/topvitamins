Omega-3 fatty acids are essential polyunsaturated fats that contribute to cardiovascular, cognitive, and joint health. Humans obtain the primary forms—EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)—mostly from marine sources, while ALA (alpha-linolenic acid) is abundant in certain plant foods. Because conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA is limited in humans, direct dietary or supplemental intake of EPA and DHA is important for many people.

## Key roles and evidence-based benefits

Clinical and epidemiological research links EPA and DHA with several health outcomes. Regular intake has been associated with modest reductions in triglyceride levels and improvements in some markers of cardiovascular risk. DHA is a structural component of neural and retinal tissue; observational and interventional studies suggest adequate DHA supports cognitive development in infancy and may influence cognitive aging. Anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3s are also well documented, with measurable benefits for joint pain and stiffness in inflammatory conditions in some randomized trials.

The magnitude of effect varies by dose, baseline intake, and clinical context. Meta-analyses indicate consistent benefits for triglyceride lowering and modest benefits for secondary prevention in certain cardiovascular conditions, whereas evidence for mood disorders and cognitive decline is mixed and often dependent on study design and dose.

## Natural sources and dietary considerations

Marine sources: Fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, and herring are rich in EPA and DHA. Regular consumption of these fish contributes directly to circulating EPA and DHA levels.

Plant sources: Flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, and canola oil provide ALA. Because conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA is inefficient, relying solely on ALA may not be sufficient for individuals with increased requirements or limited fish intake.

When dietary intake of EPA and DHA is low, supplements provide a predictable source of these fatty acids. Whether to prioritize food sources or supplements depends on dietary patterns, allergies, sustainability considerations, and individual health needs.

## Choosing and using supplements

Quality indicators for marine-based supplements include clearly stated EPA and DHA content per serving, third-party purity testing (for contaminants such as PCBs and heavy metals), and sustainability certifications. Consider product labels that report combined EPA+DHA amounts rather than total fish oil volume.

General dosage guidance for healthy adults typically recommends about 250–500 mg per day of combined EPA and DHA to maintain baseline health. Higher therapeutic doses (often 1 g or more of combined EPA+DHA) are used in specific clinical situations under medical supervision. Excessive intake can increase bleeding risk and may interact with anticoagulant medications; therefore, consult a healthcare professional before initiating high-dose therapy, during pregnancy, or when managing chronic conditions.

## Practical takeaways

Aim to include fatty fish regularly or consider a standardized supplement if dietary intake is low. Check labels for EPA and DHA content and third-party testing. Discuss higher-dose supplementation and potential interactions with a healthcare provider to ensure safe, evidence-informed use.</body></html>
