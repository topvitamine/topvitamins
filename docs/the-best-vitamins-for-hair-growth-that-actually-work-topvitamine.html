Healthy hair reflects multiple aspects of health, including nutrition. Hair grows in cycles from follicles on the scalp, and follicles need specific nutrients to support growth, strength and resistance to breakage. This article summarizes evidence-based vitamins and minerals linked to hair health and practical considerations for supplementation.

## Key vitamins for hair growth

Biotin (vitamin B7) is commonly associated with hair health because it contributes to keratin production, a structural protein in hair. Biotin deficiency can cause thinning and brittle hair; however, deficiency is uncommon in well-nourished populations. Supplemental doses often range from 30–100 mcg daily for general support, though therapeutic doses used in studies can be higher and should be guided by a clinician.

Vitamins A, C and E play supportive roles. Vitamin A helps regulate sebum production on the scalp, which can maintain a healthy environment for follicles. Vitamin C is an antioxidant and supports collagen synthesis, important for hair strand integrity. Vitamin E has antioxidant effects and may improve scalp microcirculation. These vitamins are most effective when consumed as part of a balanced diet.

## Essential minerals

Iron, zinc and magnesium are minerals frequently linked to hair outcomes. Iron carries oxygen to hair follicles; iron deficiency is a known contributor to hair shedding in some groups. Zinc is involved in protein synthesis and follicle repair; low zinc status can impair hair growth. Magnesium participates in numerous enzymatic reactions relevant to protein synthesis and inflammation control. Assessing levels through blood tests helps target supplementation appropriately—over-supplementation can also cause problems.

## Natural supplement formulas

Multinutrient supplements that combine B vitamins, vitamins A, C, E and key minerals are commonly used for hair support. Botanical extracts (such as saw palmetto or horsetail) appear in some formulas and have varying levels of supporting evidence. When choosing products, consider ingredient transparency, third-party testing and formulation (e.g., forms of minerals that enhance absorption).

## Maximizing results and safety

Dietary sources of these nutrients—eggs, nuts, leafy greens, lean meats and whole grains—are foundational. Hydration, stress management and gentle hair care practices (limiting heat, harsh chemicals and tension from tight styles) also support hair health. If hair loss or thinning persists despite reasonable nutrition, medical evaluation is appropriate to rule out underlying conditions and guide targeted therapy.
