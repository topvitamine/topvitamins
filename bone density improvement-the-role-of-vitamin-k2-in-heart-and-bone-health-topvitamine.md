# The Role of Vitamin K2 in Heart and Bone Health

Vitamin K2 is an often-overlooked nutrient that contributes to both cardiovascular and skeletal health through its role in calcium metabolism. Unlike vitamin K1, which is primarily involved in blood clotting and is abundant in leafy greens, vitamin K2 (menaquinones) helps direct calcium to bones and teeth and away from soft tissues such as arteries. This article summarizes key mechanisms, dietary sources, deficiency signals, and practical considerations based on current evidence.

## How vitamin K2 works

Vitamin K2 activates Gla-proteins, including matrix Gla-protein (MGP) in the vasculature and osteocalcin in bone. Activated MGP binds calcium in the arterial wall and inhibits calcification, which is a risk factor for arterial stiffness and cardiovascular events. Activated osteocalcin promotes incorporation of calcium into the bone matrix, supporting bone mineralization and strength. Different menaquinone subtypes (notably MK-4 and MK-7) vary in tissue distribution and half-life, with MK-7 typically showing a longer circulating half-life than MK-4.

## Evidence for heart and bone outcomes

Observational studies and some randomized trials suggest higher vitamin K2 intake is associated with reduced progression of arterial calcification and lower risk of cardiovascular disease. For bone health, trials—especially those using MK-7—have reported improvements in bone turnover markers and, in some settings, increased bone mineral density or reduced fracture risk in older adults. Evidence strength varies by outcome and study design; therefore, K2 is best considered one component of a dietary pattern and clinical strategy for bone and vascular health rather than a standalone cure.

## Sources of vitamin K2

Dietary K2 is found in fermented foods (e.g., natto), certain cheeses, and animal products such as egg yolks and liver. Intake from typical Western diets is often lower than in populations consuming natto or high-fermented-food diets. Where dietary sources are limited, supplements are used to achieve higher, more consistent intakes. When choosing products, it is useful to check the specific menaquinone form and dose.

## Recognizing deficiency and interactions

Signs potentially related to insufficient K2 activity include easy bruising, bleeding tendencies (more typical of K1 deficiency), decreased bone strength, and progressive arterial calcification over time. A clinically relevant consideration is that vitamin K can interact with vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin). Any supplementation or major dietary change should be discussed with a healthcare professional, especially for people on anticoagulant therapy.

## Practical considerations

Vitamin K2 works synergistically with calcium and vitamin D: calcium supplies the mineral, vitamin D supports its absorption, and vitamin K2 helps direct it toward bone. For people evaluating options for bone or cardiovascular health, reviewing trial evidence, examining the menaquinone form (MK-4 vs MK-7), and consulting a clinician are recommended steps.

## Conclusion

Vitamin K2 contributes to directing calcium to bone and preventing inappropriate calcification in arteries. Current evidence supports its biological plausibility and potential benefits for bone density and vascular health, although individual needs and clinical contexts vary. Clinical consultation is advised before initiating supplementation, particularly for people taking anticoagulant medications.
