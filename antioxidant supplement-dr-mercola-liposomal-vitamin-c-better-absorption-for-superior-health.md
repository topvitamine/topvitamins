# Dr. Mercola Liposomal Vitamin C: Superior Absorption Compared to Regular Vitamin C

Vitamin C is essential for immune function, collagen synthesis and antioxidant defense. However, the bioavailability of oral vitamin C varies by formulation. Liposomal vitamin C uses a phospholipid-based delivery system designed to protect ascorbic acid from early degradation in the gastrointestinal tract and promote cellular uptake. The product page for [Dr. Mercola Liposomal Vitamin C](https://www.topvitamine.com/blogs/news/dr-mercola-liposomal-vitamin-c-better-absorption-for-superior-health) outlines this approach and the rationale for choosing a liposomal form.

## What is liposomal vitamin C?

Liposomal vitamin C encapsulates ascorbic acid within microscopic lipid vesicles called liposomes, composed primarily of phospholipids similar to cell membranes. This encapsulation can reduce exposure of the vitamin to stomach acid and enzymes, and it may facilitate transport across the intestinal barrier via fusion with enterocyte membranes. Mechanistically, liposomal delivery aims to increase plasma and tissue concentrations of vitamin C compared with equivalent doses of unencapsulated ascorbic acid.

## Absorption and comparative effectiveness

Conventional oral vitamin C absorption is saturable: intestinal transporters limit uptake at higher doses and excess is typically excreted in urine. Clinical and pharmacokinetic studies indicate that liposomal formulations can achieve higher blood plasma levels than standard oral tablets or powders at comparable or lower doses. This does not necessarily mean identical clinical outcomes in every context, but enhanced plasma availability is a plausible mechanism for improved tissue delivery.

## Potential benefits and tolerability

Liposomal vitamin C retains the known physiological roles of vitamin C — antioxidant activity, support of immune cell function, and participation in collagen synthesis for skin and connective tissue. Some users report reduced gastrointestinal discomfort with liposomal forms compared to high-dose ascorbic acid, which aligns with the idea that encapsulation mitigates direct mucosal exposure. As with any supplement, individual responses vary and evidence quality ranges across outcomes.

## Dosage considerations

Typical dosing guidance for many liposomal vitamin C products is roughly 1,000 mg per day, though formulations differ in the amount of ascorbic acid and the lipid-to-vitamin ratio. Starting with a lower dose to assess tolerance is reasonable. Individuals with specific conditions, on medications, or with renal impairment should consult a healthcare professional before initiating regular supplementation.

## Conclusion

Liposomal vitamin C represents a formulation strategy intended to improve oral bioavailability through lipid encapsulation. Evidence supports enhanced plasma levels with liposomal preparations versus standard oral ascorbic acid, which may translate into improved tissue delivery and tolerability for some users. Decisions about supplementation should be guided by individual needs, existing health conditions and consultation with a qualified healthcare professional.
