# What Are Adaptogens and Do You Need Them?

Adaptogen supplements are a category of botanical remedies that have attracted interest for their potential to support the body's response to stress. Rather than acting as stimulants or sedatives, adaptogens are proposed to help normalize physiological processes and increase resilience to physical, chemical, and biological stressors.

## What Are Adaptogens?

Adaptogens are typically herbs or plant extracts that influence systems involved in stress regulation, including the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and related neuroendocrine pathways. Research suggests some adaptogens may modulate cortisol production, improve cellular energy metabolism, and influence neurotransmitter systems involved in mood and cognition. Evidence ranges from traditional use and animal studies to a growing number of human trials; however, the strength of evidence varies by botanical.

## Common Types of Adaptogens

- Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera): Used in Ayurvedic medicine, ashwagandha is among the most studied adaptogens. Randomized trials report reductions in stress and anxiety scales and improvements in sleep quality and markers of cortisol when taken at common doses (often 300–600 mg/day of standardized extract).

- Rhodiola rosea: Grown in cold climates, rhodiola is studied for fatigue and endurance. Some trials indicate improved mental performance and reduced subjective fatigue at typical doses of 100–400 mg/day of standardized extract.

- Other herbs: Holy basil (Ocimum tenuiflorum), Panax ginseng, and Eleutherococcus senticosus (eleuthero) are also commonly categorized as adaptogens and have varying degrees of clinical data supporting effects on stress resilience and physical performance.

## Adaptogen Benefits — What the Evidence Shows

Potential benefits reported across studies include reduced perceived stress and anxiety, improved sleep quality, decreased fatigue, and modest improvements in cognitive function during stress. Mechanistic studies suggest effects on cortisol regulation, antioxidant defenses, and neurotransmitter balance. Importantly, while some clinical trials are promising, many studies are small or heterogeneous in design, so conclusions should be cautious and individualized.

## Who Might Consider Adaptogen Supplements?

People experiencing chronic low-grade stress, persistent fatigue, or difficulty concentrating under pressure may consider adaptogens as one component of a broader strategy that includes sleep hygiene, nutrition, exercise, and psychological interventions. Athletes sometimes use adaptogens to support endurance and recovery. Those with significant medical conditions, pregnancy, or concurrent medications should consult a clinician before starting any supplement.

## Safety, Dosing, and Practical Use

Quality and standardization matter: choose products from reputable manufacturers with third-party testing when possible. Typical starting ranges reported in the literature are about 300–600 mg/day for ashwagandha and 100–400 mg/day for rhodiola, but formulations vary. Mild adverse effects can include gastrointestinal upset, headaches, or dizziness. Discontinue use and seek medical advice if adverse reactions occur.
