# Now Foods vs Healthy Origins Omega‑3: Which Fish Oil Is Best?

Omega‑3 supplements are widely used to support cardiovascular, cognitive, and joint health. Quality, purity, and the amounts of EPA and DHA per serving determine a product's likely effectiveness. This article provides an evidence‑based comparison of Now Foods and Healthy Origins fish oil products to help you evaluate trade‑offs between dosage, formulation, and testing.

## Brand overview

Now Foods is a long‑standing supplement company known for a broad product range and accessible pricing. The brand emphasizes Good Manufacturing Practices and keeps a focus on value and availability.

Healthy Origins positions itself around ingredient sourcing and potency, often highlighting refined extraction methods and independent lab testing. Both brands publish certificates or summaries of third‑party analyses to support transparency.

## Fish oil quality

Sourcing: Both companies use cold‑water species (e.g., anchovy, sardine), which are typically richer in EPA and DHA and lower in contaminants compared with some larger predatory fish.

Purification and testing: Now Foods commonly uses multi‑step purification and adheres to GMP; some of its products also reference third‑party verification. Healthy Origins frequently reports molecular distillation and independent potency testing. Both brands aim to limit heavy metals, PCBs, and other industrial contaminants through established refinery techniques.

## EPA and DHA content

EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) are the primary omega‑3s linked to cardiovascular and neurological benefits. Typical formulations differ by concentration: Now Foods omega‑3 products often provide about 500 mg combined EPA+DHA per serving, while Healthy Origins formulations sometimes provide around 600 mg per serving. These are approximate figures from product labels and may vary by SKU.

Higher EPA/DHA per serving can increase the likelihood of measurable physiological effects at lower capsule counts, but individual needs vary based on health goals, diet, and clinician recommendations.

## Effectiveness and absorption

Formulation affects bioavailability. Triglyceride (TG)‑form fish oils are generally better absorbed than ethyl ester (EE)‑form oils in clinical studies; some Now Foods products are TG‑form, which can support improved uptake. Healthy Origins emphasizes refined extraction and formulation choices that aim to enhance bioavailability as well. Consistent daily intake is a major determinant of benefit, and individual digestion differences can influence tolerability.

## Customer feedback and price/value

User reports for both brands commonly mention perceived improvements in joint comfort, mood stability, and overall wellbeing. Common differentiators in reviews include capsule size, aftertaste, and perceived potency. Now Foods often represents a more budget‑friendly option; Healthy Origins may cost more but can offer higher EPA/DHA per serving depending on the product.

## Final verdict

Both Now Foods and Healthy Origins produce reputable, tested fish oil supplements. Choose Now Foods if you prioritize affordability and broad availability; consider Healthy Origins if you want higher label concentrations of EPA+DHA and focused sourcing claims. Match product selection to your daily dosage goals, formulation preference (TG vs EE), and independent test data.
